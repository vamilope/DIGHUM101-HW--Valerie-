      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    pandas - a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python\n",
      "    =====================================================================\n",
      "    \n",
      "    **pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data\n",
      "    structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both\n",
      "    easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n",
      "    doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n",
      "    the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n",
      "    analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n",
      "    its way toward this goal.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Main Features\n",
      "    -------------\n",
      "    Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
      "    \n",
      "      - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n",
      "        point data.\n",
      "      - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n",
      "        higher dimensional objects\n",
      "      - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n",
      "        to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n",
      "        `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
      "        computations.\n",
      "      - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n",
      "        operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n",
      "      - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n",
      "        and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n",
      "      - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n",
      "        data sets.\n",
      "      - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n",
      "      - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",
      "      - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n",
      "      - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n",
      "        Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n",
      "        format.\n",
      "      - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n",
      "        conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,\n",
      "        date shifting and lagging, etc.\n",

the 5th meeting on 29 October 2014 The delegation of Fiji was headed by Aiyaz SayedKhaiyum AttorneyGeneral and Minister of Justice At its 10th meeting held on 31 October 2014 the Working Group adopted the report on Fiji \\n2 On 15 January 2014 the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs troika to facilitate the review of Fiji Japan Namibia and the Russian Federation \\n3 In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 51 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 1621 the following documents were issued for the review of Fiji \\na A national report submittedwritten presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 a AHRCWG620FJI1  \\nb A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR in

Liechtenstein Mexico Netherlands Slovenia Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Fiji through the troika The questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review UPR \\n I Summary of the proceedings of the review process \\n A Presentation by the State under review \\n5 Opening statements by the Fijian delegation were made by the AttorneyGeneral and Minister for Justice the Chief Justice the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chairman of the Media Industry Development Authority \\n6 The commitment of Fiji to promoting and protecting the fundamental principles and values of universal human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been affirmed in the Fijian Constitution adopted on 7 September 2013 The first Constitution in Fiji to eliminate the legal enforcement of ethnic voting and to include social and economic rights as well as civil and political rights it had created a transformative human rights normative framework for the people of Fiji Under the Constitution the State was legally obliged to protect and promote those rights \\n7 Fiji had held elections under the Constitution on 17 September 2014 with an 846 per cent participation rate of registered voters and a record low 075 per cent of invalid ballots In a preliminary statement the Multinational Observer Group had deemed the elections credible and representative of the will of the Fijian people \\n8 In addition to the human rights set forth in the core international human rights instruments Fiji urged the Human Rights Council to address emerging human rights issues \\nincluding transborder impacts of climate change asylum policies and consequences of free trade agreements on social and economic rights \\n9 In response to questions on the ratification of international human rights instruments from Belgium Mexico and the United Kingdom Fiji confirmed that it was not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Nonetheless the robust Bill of Rights in the Constitution went beyond obligations under those instruments and placed an obligation on the State to promote and protect those rights for all Fijians Those rights were applied directly by the Fijian judiciary Approval of the ratification of those international instruments was the prerogative of Parliament \\n10 Fiji remained amenable to inviting special procedures mandate holders to visit the country However it was operating in an entirely new political social and legislative environment Fiji wanted to be in a position to ratify those instruments and have the resources to host and meet the standards of the mandate holders before inviting them \\n11 WomenÕs rights in Fiji were in line with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women CEDAW which Fiji had ratified in 1995 In response to questions from ten countries on steps taken to end discrimination and violence against women Fiji acknowledged the challenges posed by those issues New initiatives included updated provisions in the Crimes Decree for the offences of rape and sexual assault the passing and application of the Domestic Violence Decree judicial training a new National Gender Policy and gender training for civil servants Fiji corrected the claim made by the Netherlands that the Constitution did not protect women by listing the newly protected grounds in addition to sex and gender in the Bill of Rights which included gender identity and expression pregnancy and marital status and constituted broad protection from discrimination against women allowing for the legal expression of intersectional discrimination It was also clarified that the higher levels of reported cases of domestic violence about which concern had been raised in fact reflected higher reporting by victims owing to their confidence in the abovementioned initiatives \\n12 Those measures would only be meaningful if all stakeholders played their part in shaping societyÕs attitudes towards zero tolerance of discrimination and violence against women Training and participation by the police civil society the judiciary and prosecutors was also required It was important for civil society organizations to familiarize themselves with those laws and initiatives because they were empowered to represent women in the legal system under the Domestic Violence Decree \\n13 The Domestic Violence Decree did not establish domestic violence as an offence the charge would remain one of assault under the Crimes Decree However there were important provisions in the Domestic Violence Decree that could be used to protect women \\n14 Responding to questions from Belgium and Estonia on the International Criminal Court the delegation said that Fiji had been one of the first States to ratify the Rome Statute and it remained steadfastly committed to the International Criminal Court The countryÕs domestic legislation is in full complementarity with the provisions of the Rome Statute and domestic legislation through the Crimes Decree \\n15 Responding to questions from Ethiopia and Switzerland on rights visˆvis limitations in the Fijian Constitution Fiji explained that the burden was on the State to prove that the limitations were necessary The law must always promote the values that underlay a democratic society based on human dignity equality and freedom In addition section 7 of the Bill of Rights underpinning those democratic principles guided the courtsÕ interpretations and allowed them to consider international law in their decisions \\n16 Responding to questions about the abolition of the death penalty asked by France Germany and Namibia Fiji noted that it had abolished the death penalty in 2001 However it remained in the Military Code indirectly by virtue of the applicability of the Army Act 1955 of the United Kingdom Fiji announced that in the forthcoming session of Parliament the Military Code would be amended to remove the reference to the death penalty altogether \\n17 Responding to questions and recommendations from Germany New Zealand and the Republic of Korea on human rights abuses in particular alleged torture and illtreatment by the police Fiji explained that in cases in which complaints were made to the police and in which the Director of Public Prosecutions determined that there was sufficient evidence for prosecution the perpetrators had been prosecuted Indeed some were currently serving terms of imprisonment for such acts \\n18 The new legal framework of Fiji under the Constitution allowed steps to be taken to ensure that police procedures were modernized and made more transparent It was acknowledged that torture during interrogation had been a longstanding problem in Fiji owing to cultural misconceptions inherited from attitudes prevalent in Europe within living memory Therefore in order to avoid lengthy court proceedings to determine whether confessions and statements had been obtained under torture the judiciary had itself provided budgetary resources to launch a project under which all interviews of suspects in custody would be video recorded and would provide additional funds and training for the investigators That had been done in recognition of the fact that institutions must combine their resources in order to eliminate impropriety and violent treatment and to ensure a more efficient justice system \\n19 The police had also acknowledged deficiencies in police investigations and aspects of police culture that in the past had excused or ignored police brutality and that training was needed in the areas of domestic violence and interrogations Specialized organizations had been invited to cooperate with relevant Fijian agencies in the provision of such training so as to improve the human rights standing of the criminal justice system in Fiji In further response to concerns raised about assaults and brutality in police custody the delegation explained that in cases in which evidence had been obtained by means of assault by the police the prosecution would not continue and the matter would be referred to the Commissioner of Police for investigation and possible criminal charges against the officers Such cases had most recently resulted in the prosecution and conviction of three police officers who had been convicted of murder by joint enterprise and two who had been convicted of being accessories after the fact when a young man had died in police custody \\n20 The Fijian criminal justice system was explained with particular emphasis on the processes followed between the lodging of a criminal complaint and the decision on whether or not to proceed with the prosecution It was emphasized that the police were also independent of the Government and the Director of Public Prosecutions with regard to how police investigations were conducted and that the police could only act if a formal written complaint was made by a person including if the complaint was one of unfair treatment by the police  \\n B Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review \\n21 During the interactive

recommendations \\n38 Germany welcomed the Bill of Rights contained in the new Constitution It commended the abolitionist approach taken towards the death penalty for over two decades Germany made recommendations \\n39 Fiji indicated that the Human Rights and AntiDiscrimination Commission would now serve as the predominant enforcement body for the Bill of Rights guaranteed under the Constitution The Constitution provided for the independence of the Commission in its functions and in the exercise of its authority and powers including administrative autonomy and control over its own budget and finances In order to fulfil its mandate which included enforcing and monitoring compliance with the human rights instruments ratified by the Government including by bringing proceedings before the courts Parliament had to provide adequate funding and resources for the Commission OHCHR and development partners were invited to work with the Government to strengthen the capacity of the Commission and ensure compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights Paris Principles \\n40 The meritocracy approach to the Fijian public service had done away with discriminatory policies that had promoted an elite agenda and clique rather than addressing the inequalities they had claimed to address \\n41 The Chief Justice refuted any insinuations that the Fijian judiciary was not independent and that it was subject to the direction and control of the Government The appointment of judicial officers was handled by the Judicial Services Commission and consultation with not concurrence or approval of the AttorneyGeneral was required In the case of disagreement it was ultimately the CommissionÕs final decision Comments to the effect that the Government controlled the judiciary were therefore erroneous Representation on the Commission of members and nonmembers of the Bar and video recording of its proceedings were a noticeable improvement from the situation under the 1997 Constitution The appointment process of members to the Commission was considerably less subject to political influence and control Furthermore new protections had been introduced into the 2013 Constitution providing for the independence and autonomy of the judiciary in section 97 \\n42 The only two judicial appointments controlled by the Government were those of the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal under procedures that were the same as those contained in the 1997 Constitution and similar to other jurisdictions The \\narrangements under the current Constitution for judicial appointments were a noticeable improvement from previous constitutions \\n43 The only interference in the Fijian judiciary had been the travel bans placed by Australia and New Zealand on members of the Fijian judiciary appointed after 2009 which had prevented suitably qualified persons who might have served on the judicial bench from doing so Sri Lankan assistance in allowing the secondment of its judiciary to Fiji had enabled the judiciary in Fiji to continue to function effectively \\n44 Section 97 of the Fijian Constitution had brought the judiciary into compliance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers \\n45 The Chief Justice said that a substantial training programme had been put in place for the judiciary in order to enable all its members to be fully cognizant with human rights issues including awareness of and sensitivity to gender issues and children in court Training input and assistance from specialist nongovernmental organizations NGOs would be welcomed However the judiciary could not discuss individual cases with NGOs and requests for information and letters seeking intervention with a view to appeal were better addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions \\n46 Other developments in the judicial sector had included the introduction of sittings conducted in open court except in cases involving childrenÕs evidence trade secrets copyright or national security Video recording of all court proceedings would also be introduced in the near future In order to improve access to justice and in line with the Bill of Rights in the Constitution new lifts for the disabled cr\\x8fches and rooms for vulnerable witnesses had been introduced in courts \\n47 The Chief Justice had issued a directive indicating that no case in which the applicability of ouster clauses was challenged could be

whether resources for socioeconomic programmes had been allocated and how development partners could help It also asked what barriers there were to the functioning of the judiciary and how the international community could provide assistance It made a recommendation \\n67 In response to the questions pertaining to the media and freedom of speech of expression and of the press Fiji stated that it did not accept the premise of the questions asked on the Media Industry Development Decree since those questions had implied or stated outright that the media framework was restrictive andor that there was censorship of the media \\n68 Through its Bill of Rights the Fijian Constitution unequivocally recognized freedom of the press as pivotal to the realization of freedom of speech expression thought opinion and publication \\n69 Fiji shared the concerns that had been voiced about the fact that repressive laws could severely restrict press freedom Fiji had taken significant steps in securing greater rights and freedoms However no country guaranteed unfettered freedom without responsibility While guaranteeing freedom of speech expression thought opinion and of the press the Constitution explicitly prohibited any speech opinion or expression that was tantamount to war propaganda incitement to violence or insurrection against the Constitution or advocated hatred based on any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination which included race culture ethnic or social origin sex gender sexual orientation and gender identity language economic social or health status disability age and religion Those limitations were also in line with general recommendation No 35 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on combating racist hate speech \\n70 The Fijian Constitution contained a definition of hate speech that was comparable to that in the German legal framework given the history of religious and racial intolerance Training to ensure that the media understood where to draw the line between free speech and limitations on free speech in accordance with international law especially the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights was of paramount importance \\n71 The Public Emergency Regulations had been revoked The Media Industry Development Decree 2010 through a very progressive Media Code of Ethics and the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of the press and protected the confidentiality of journalistic sources in line with a decision of the European Court of Human Rights and article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights It also encouraged robust debate without inciting hatred and was consistent with the law on justifiable limitations to free speech under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR and the European Convention It should be noted that the Media Code of Ethics in the Media Industry Development Decree 2010 had been copied verbatim from the Code of Ethics adopted by the previous selfregulated Media Council \\n72 The Media Industry Development Authority had called for balanced accurate and evidencebased reporting encouraging quality journalism that was ethical and followed internationally recognized protocols of responsible journalism \\n73 The Media Industry Development Decree 2010 provided for an independent media tribunal presided over by a High Court judge which adjudicated in cases of breaches of media codes or matters relating to media disputes Only one prosecution had taken place under the Media Industry Development Authority in relation to foreign ownership of a media organization There had been no prosecution of any media organization for breaches of the Code of Ethics or regarding media content \\n74 The Media Industry Development Authority had actively encouraged the mainstream media both print and broadcast to report freely and critically on public opinion and views including those which were critical of the Government The consistent call from the Media Industry Development Authority for selfregulation and continuous education of the media was consistent with the recent call from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO in its 2014 report ÒWorld trends in freedom of expression and media developmentÓ to strengthen national legislative frameworks and the training of journalists in order to build capacity and improve media and information literacy and to support media independence by promoting professional standards and selfregulation \\n75 Training for journalists had been conducted on the Media Code of Ethics the Bill of Rights and on reporting the elections In addition there were plans to work with the United Nations Development Programme on training for the Fijian media on reporting parliamentary debates The Government welcomed the ILO proposal to provide training for the Fijian media on labour rights Those collaborative efforts between Fiji and the international community signalled an encouraging positive step towards constructive engagement in improving the freedom of the press Civil society organizations were invited to enter into similar collaborative arrangements to further strengthen the media \\n76 Portugal welcomed the Constitution emphasized the importance of Human Rights Council special procedures and noted the participation of women in

efforts to improve access to justice including for underprivileged communities through the \\nLegal Aid Commission Plans to expand poorer childrenÕs access to tertiary education and the granting of scholarships were welcomed Singapore made recommendations \\n81 Slovenia asked about the timeline for removing the death penalty from the Military Code and welcomed the Constitution and the Human

reiterated that the human rights aspects of climate change such as the sovereignty issues faced by lowlying countries facing flooding and the human rights of peoples facing displacement as a result of

As a group we are reading the Schulz article \"What is Distant Reading?\" to define the value of doing distant readings. I am also reading Chu's article on data cleaning to present issues with data quality in data analysis (as a sort of counter argument). Utlimately, we are arguing that CLS allows people to use news tools to assist in understanding texts, not as a way to replace close readings but to see new quantitative aspects of texts that we would not have otherwise had without the use of technology.
